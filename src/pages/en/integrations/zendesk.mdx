How to integrate Zendesk with OpenReplay.

Easiest way to integrate Zendesk with Openreplay is to use the [Text app](https://www.zendesk.com/marketplace/apps/support/1691/text/) to  add a link to user's sessions to your ticket pages.

## Installation

- Install the free [Text app](https://www.zendesk.com/marketplace/apps/support/1691/text/) from the Zendesk marketplace.

- Specify a preferred title (i.e "Openreplay links").

- For the text display, you can follow this format (making sure to change OPENREPLAY_DOMAIN and PROJECT_ID with valid address and ID)

```
https://<OPENREPLAY_DOMAIN>/<PROJECT_ID>/sessions?uid=is|{{ticket.requester.email}}&range=LAST_24_HOURS
```

- To view the link, navigate to a ticket and open the Apps panel by clicking the Apps button in the upper right.

## Changing the format

You can test your link format by going to your OpenReplay instance and changing the search, starting with User Id filter,
then adding any important events, for example, this query searches for
all sessions that had a bad request and are associated with the user email:

```
https://<OPENREPLAY_DOMAIN>/<PROJECT_ID>/sessions?uid=is|{{ticket.requester.email}}&iss=is|bad_request&range=LAST_24_HOURS
```
