metaDescription: "Details about the 'uploadOfflineRecording' method from OpenReplay's SDK"
---

This method stops the recording and attempts to start uploading buffered messages to backend.
It has to be awaited in order to make sure that all messages are pushed into service worker.

> Note: Keep in mind that only user device time will be used for timestamps. (no backend delay sync)

## Signature

```ts
uploadOfflineRecording(): Promise<void>
```

> Use `onSessionSent` hook to trigger any additional actions when session is fully saved to backend.
