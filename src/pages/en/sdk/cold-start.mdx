Starts buffering messages without starting the actual session, buffer will keep last 30 seconds of events and you can activate
session by calling `start()` or by conditional trigger (EE license required)

## Signature

```ts
coldStart(startOpts?: Partial<StartOptions>, isConditional?: boolean): Promise<void>
```

### Parameters
With the `startOpts` you can customize different aspects of the recording:
- `userID: string`: used to manually set the user ID to track it across sessions. This is a string value and it can be anything you want.
- `metadata: Record<string, string>`: manually set metadata values. Check the [Metadata section](/installation/metadata/) to learn more about this feature.
- `forceNew: boolean`: used to force a new session after page refresh. By default it's set to `false`, so after a refresh the session is kept.
- `sessionHash: string`: used for sticky sessions. Useful if you have a multi-site application or if you have to redirect the user outside and then back into your site (like to a payment gateway).

`isConditional` decides if tracker should wait for trigger condition to be met before starting the session automatically.

> Note: conditional recording is only supported by Enterprise Edition.

### Return value

This method does not return any value.
