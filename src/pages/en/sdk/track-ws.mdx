If the default information tracked by our tracker when a JS error occurs is not enough, you can use this method. The `handleError` method manually reports caught exceptions, rejected promises or error events. See [error reporting](/installation/error-reporting#manuallyloggingexceptions) for more details.

## Signature

```ts 
trackWs: (channelName: string) => (msgType: string, data: string, dir: 'up' | 'down') => void
```

## Parameters

- `channelName: string`: Name of the WS channel.

## Return value

Returns a hook to apply to ws messages that takes msg type (or name), data and message direction (up/down === sent/received) as parameters.
