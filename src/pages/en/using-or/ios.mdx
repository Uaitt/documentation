## Installation

The following line will install the tracker and with it the SDK for you to take advantage of all tracker features.

```bash
insert command here later
```

## Adding the tracking code

Add the following code to your AppDelegate.swift file:

```swift
// AppDelegate.swift
import ORTracker

//... 

class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {
    
    func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
        
        ORTracker.shared.serverURL = "https://your.instance.com/ingest" // not required if you're using our SaaS version
        ORTracker.shared.start(projectKey: "projectkey", options: .defaults) // check out our SDK docs to see available options
        
        // ...
        return true
			}
	```

	<Aside type="tip">
		**A note for self-hosted users**: if you're using the self-hosted version of OpenReplay, you'll also have to specify the `serverURL` configuration property. 
		This property specifies the ingestion endpoint for the tracker’s data. Cloud users don’t need this, 
		because by default the tracker will now where the SaaS version of this endpoint is, but if you’re self-hosting it, you’ll need to specify it 
		(it should be something like `https://openreplay.mydomain.com/ingest`) 
	</Aside>

	### Handling the "projectKey" in your code

	As a note, the `projectKey` that you configure is the one provided by OpenReplay’s platform. This value should not be stored hardcoded in your code for security reasons, but rather on some kind of configuration file/sytem.
	
	## Have questions?
