## My installation suddenly stopped working
   
There might be multiple reasons for that. Here's how you can debug the situation:

1. Check the disk usage in the OpenReplay VM. If it's more than 80%, the services won't run.

```bash  
df -h
```

## Upgrade failed without any particular error
   
### I see "helm or another operation (install/upgrade/rollback) is in progress"

This usually means that you retried the installation/upgrade operation multiple times. Run the below command to resolve the situation:

```bash
helm rollback -n app openreplay
```

### I see no errors, just "installation failed"

```bash
# Check for failed pods
kubectl get pods -n app --field-selector="status.phase!=Succeeded,status.phase!=Running" -o custom-columns="POD:metadata.name"
        
# Check for the err logs
stern -n app `pod name from above`
 ```
