## Hosting OpenReplay with other applications using reverse proxy

When OR is running in a machine, it'll use port 80/443 to expose the application. But when you're using reverse proxy, OR can be configured to use another port to access the application.

For that you can follow the steps below:

1. Edit OR config file
```bash
openreplay -e
```

2. Go to nginx config section

```yaml
ingress-nginx: &ingress-nginx
  controller:
	...
	...
    service:
      externalTrafficPolicy: "Local"
      ports:
        http: 880   # Change this port for http
        https: 8443 # Change this port for https
```
3. Save and exit the config using `:wq` and OpenReplay will reload the configuration.


## Your reverse can be configured referring the following section.

## NGINX settings

Make sure your proxy is sending the `X-Forwarded-For` and `X-Forwarded-Proto` headers. SSL must also be enabled for OpenReplay to work. The rest of the config should look like this:

```nginx
location / {
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
        proxy_redirect off;
        proxy_pass http://1.2.3.4:880; # replace with OpenReplay instance IP
    }
```

## Apache2 settings

Ensure `proxy`, `proxy_http` and `proxy_html` modules are enabled. SSL too should be configured, the rest of the settings should be similar to this:

```apacheconf
<VirtualHost *:443>
    ProxyPass / http://1.2.3.4:880 <!-- replace with instance IP -->
    RequestHeader set X-Forwarded-Proto expr=%{REQUEST_SCHEME}
    # SSL + other config here
</VirtualHost>
```

## Public endpoints

In case you're protecting your OpenReplay instance with a proxy, ensure the below endpoints are publicly accessible for OpenReplay to work properly.

| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| /ingest | For capturing events and recordings |
| /api | For pulling and managing user data |
| /assist | For live video/calls with end users (WebRTC) |
| /ws-assist | For live session replays with end users |
| /static/openreplay.js | JavaScript code that loads OpenReplay |
