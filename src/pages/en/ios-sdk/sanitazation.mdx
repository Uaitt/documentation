## Sanitizing UI Components

Sanitized views will be blurred out in the resulting replay.
You can add any UI component and it will be automatically removed (to preserve memory) as soon as its not on screen.

### SwiftUI

Simply add `.sensitive()` modifier to desired component

```swift
import ORTracker

Text("Very important sensitive text")
.sensitive()

```

### UIKit

```swift
import ORTracker

ORTracker.shared.addIgnoredView(view)
```
