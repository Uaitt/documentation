Canvas elements are streamed by tracker (version 11.0.0 + assist version of 7.0.0 and above) automatically, but they are only recorded if this option is enabled on the backend.

## Live Replay Settings

For live streaming, no settings are necessary. Canvas streaming will be enabled by default and data will be transmitted by P2P protocol.
To ensure optimal network usage, data is only streamed when someone is connected to live session and canvas image is changing.

## Canvas Recording

Available settings for canvas recording:
- `canvasEnabled: boolean` - controls whether canvas recording is enabled or not. Default: `false`
- `canvasQuality: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high'` - controls the quality of the canvas recording snapshot images.
- `canvasFps: number` - controls the fps of the canvas recording.

To configure canvas recording you have to change some env variables in backend/Dockerfile:
```
RECORD_CANVAS = true | false
CANVAS_QUALITY = 'low' | 'medium' | 'high'
CANVAS_FPS = integer value
```
